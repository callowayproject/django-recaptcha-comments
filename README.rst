=========
Django Captcha Comments 
=========

This plugin is intended to modify django's built-in comment system such that the user is required to solve a reCAPTCHA before commenting.

TODO:

- Add a demonstration site
- Document how to use it
- test setup.py for functionality
- submit to PyPI
- write a paver(?) script to generate the docs (or rake? or just a script?)
