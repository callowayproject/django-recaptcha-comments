Django Captcha Comments 
=========

This plugin is intended to modify django's built-in comment system such that the user is required to solve a reCAPTCHA before commenting.

This code owes a heavy debt to Marco Fucci. Indeed, it is mainly a wrapper and a
set of documentation around the code he [provided here](http://www.marcofucci.com/tumblelog/26/jul/2009/integrating-recaptcha-with-django/). Thanks, Marco!

I assume that his code was usable as open source; I've licensed this project as WTFPL with the intention of making it as widely usable as possible.

TODO:

- Documentation!
  - link demo app pages to the appropriate documentation
- test setup.py for functionality
- submit to PyPI
- write a paver(?) script to generate the docs (or rake? or just a script?)
- create a github site for the project
